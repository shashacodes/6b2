       <dd>The nervous system includes the brain, spinal cord, and a complex network of nerves.
                 This system sends messages back and forth between the brain and the body. The brain
                  is what controls all the body's functions. The spinal cord runs from the brain down
                   through the back.</dd>
                <em> The nervous system allows us to sensory
               stimuli as light, sound, smell, and touch from our environment.</em> </dd>
            <dd> It also allows rapid communication of stimuli within our body, such as sensations
                ofpain, illness, and wellness.
                The nervous system accomplishes all of this using highly specialized cells called
                neurons, which can transmit signals extremely fast by firing electrochemical potentials
