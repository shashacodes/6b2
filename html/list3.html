            <dd> The respiratory system is the network of organs and tissues that help you breathe.
                It includes your airways, lungs and blood vessels. The muscles that power your lungs
                are also part of the respiratory system. These parts work together to move oxygen
                throughout the body and clean out waste gases like carbon dioxide.

            </dd>

            <dd>Exchange of oxygen and carbon-dioxide between the body and air, acid-base balance regulation, phonation.
            </dd>

            reproductive system
            <dd> <strong>Production of reproductive cells and contribution towards</strong> the reproduction process.
            </dd>
            <dd> This system is related to the production of offspring. It includes ovaries, uterus,
                mammary glands (breasts), penis, and testes. The reproductive system is not essential
                to individual survival, but it is essential for the survival of the species. </dd>

            nervous systems
            <em>It includes the brain and nerves. The nervous</em> system allows us to sensory stimuli
            as light, sound, smell, and touch from our environment. </dd>
            <dd> It also allows rapid communication of stimuli within our body, such as sensations of pain, illness, and
                wellness.
                The nervous system accomplishes all of this using highly specialized cells called neurons, which can
                transmit signals extremely fast by firing electrochemical potentials.</dd>
